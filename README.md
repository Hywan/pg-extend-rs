# Rust based postgres extension

The main things provided by this crate are some macros that help with writing Postgres extensions in Rust.

The objective (not all these are yet implemented):

- Automatic type conversions, see `PgDatum` and `TryFromPgDatum` to `Into<PgDatum>`
- `pg_magic` macro for declaring libraries as Postgres extensions
- `pg_extern` attribute for wrapping Rust functions in Postgres C style definitions
- *tbd* allocator that uses Postgres allocators
- *tbs* panic handlers for conversion into Postgres errors
